<summary>Four countries have developed systems to achieve global coverage. </br>
US developed GPS, China developed COMPASS, EU developed Galileo, and Russia developed GLONASS System. </br>
The difficulty of roaming in space is resulting from these independent systems. </br>
Wireless mobile communication networks of the seventh generation (7G) are going to unite [14]. </br>
Fiber optics and radio are combined to create 6G Internet. Their service is based on Line of Sight (LOS) transmission. </br>
Because the copper cable is no longer necessary or our speed based on distance from the exchange, they don't have to rely on the copper cable.</br>

<summary>Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user’s intent. </br>
For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. </br>
In other words, these models are not aligned with their users.

▶ [Object Recognition via AI-Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is Near-SNR-Independent.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maloam/mqr/2452559f46cbfcf2adcaafaa3aa64bf2d6264179/JCAS_based_object_identification_using_ML.pdf) </br>
Object recognition refers to identifying the presence of a physical object through wireless sensing techniques. </br>
ICAS wireless sensing techniques operate at a shared wavelength, enabling both communication and radar-like sensing within the same spectrum. </br>
The effect of the signal-to-noise ratio on the results is smaller than anticipated. </br>
