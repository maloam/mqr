Making language models bigger does not inherently make them <i>better</i> at following a user’s intent. </br>
For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. </br>
In other words, these models are not <i>aligned</i> with their users. </br>

</br>
</br>
We have trained language assistants that are both <i>helpful</i> and <i>harmless</i> without using human feedback labels for harmlessness. </br>
We referred to the technique as ‘constitutional AI’ (CAI) since we used a ‘constitution’ consisting of human-written principles. </br>
[...]</br>
We used this method to train models that are both <i>harmless</i> and <i>non-evasive</i>, partially resolving an issue in [Bai et al., 2022].</br>

Our ultimate goal is <i>not</i> to remove human supervision entirely,... </br>
